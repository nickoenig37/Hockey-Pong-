    -- math.max ensures that it's at the greater of 0 or the player's
    -- current calculated Y position when pressing up so that we don't
    -- go into the negatives; the movement calculation is simply our
    -- previously-defined paddle speed scaled by dt

    love.graphics.rectangle('fill', self.x, self.y, self.width, self.height)
--  To be called by our main function in `love.draw`, ideally. Uses
--  LÃ–VE2D's `rectangle` function, which takes in a draw mode as the first
--  argument as well as the position and dimensions for the rectangle. To
--  change the color, one must call `love.graphics.setColor`.
